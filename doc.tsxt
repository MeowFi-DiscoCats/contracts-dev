Curvance Time Vault Contract Explained in Simple Terms
This contract is like a special savings account where you can deposit money (in the form of an ERC20 token called SHMON) to earn rewards over time. Here's how it works:

Main Features
NFT-Based System: When you deposit money, you get NFTs (digital certificates) representing your share.

Time Lock: Your money is locked for certain periods to earn rewards.

Automatic Compounding: The contract automatically reinvests earnings to grow your money faster.

Bribe System: People can add extra rewards (bribes) to encourage participation.

Key Functions Explained Simply
1. Joining the Vault
joinVault(): Deposit SHMON tokens to get NFTs (like buying shares)

swapAndJoin(): Swap other tokens for SHMON and join in one step

swapEthAndJoin(): Swap ETH for SHMON and join in one step

2. Managing Your Investment
automateCoumpounding(): Automatically reinvests earnings (only works during certain periods)

claimBack(): Withdraw your money + rewards when the time is right

3. Admin Functions
changeTimePeriod(): Owner can adjust lock periods

changeFees(): Owner can adjust fees

collectFee(): Owner collects platform fees

pauseNft(): Owner can pause NFT transfers

4. Bribe System
bribe(): Anyone can add extra rewards (in any token) to the pool

5. Helper Functions
getState(): Checks if it's deposit, earning, or withdrawal time

getNftCount(): Shows how many NFTs exist

getBalanceNft(): Shows your NFT balance and value

The NFT Part (TimeNft Contract)
The NFTs represent your share in the vault:

They can't be transferred when the system is paused

They have a fixed limit (can't create unlimited)

They give you rights to withdraw your share later

They have royalty fees (5%) if sold on marketplaces

How It Works Step-by-Step
Deposit Phase: You deposit SHMON tokens and get NFTs

Earning Phase: Your money earns rewards (automatically reinvested)

Withdrawal Phase: You burn NFTs to get your original deposit + rewards

Bribes: Extra rewards are distributed to all participants

Important Notes
There are fees (1% platform fee, 0.1% swap fee)

Money is locked for set periods

The owner can adjust some settings

Uses Uniswap-like swapping for easy token conversions

This system is designed to reward long-term participation while allowing some flexibility in how you deposit funds (either directly with SHMON or by swapping other tokens/ETH).
